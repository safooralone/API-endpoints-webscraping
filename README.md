# 📡 API Endpoint Data Scraper

This project demonstrates how to scrape data directly from **API endpoints** by sending HTTP requests, parsing the JSON responses, and exporting the retrieved data in a structured JSON format using Python.

It is a lightweight and efficient alternative to traditional web scraping, ideal for developers who want clean access to data without dealing with HTML parsing or JavaScript-rendered content.

## 🚀 Project Description

The **API Endpoint Data Scraper** is a Python-based project designed to:

- Send HTTP requests to RESTful APIs.
- Parse JSON responses.
- Extract relevant data.
- Process and clean the data.
- Export the final output into a JSON file for further use.

This approach is fast, accurate, and reliable — especially for public APIs that serve structured data.
